Project Name: Portfolio-OS (Fallout 4-Inspired Terminal Portfolio)
Tech Stack: Svelte, TypeScript, Vite, Svelte Stores, HTML/CSS, LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), RESTful API, Playwright (E2E testing)

Problem Solved:
Designed to provide an immersive, accessible, and customizable portfolio experience, Portfolio-OS addresses the need for a distinctive, keyboard-navigable personal website that showcases projects and skills while emulating the retro-futuristic terminal interface of Fallout 4.

Key Features / Functionality:

Fully keyboard-navigable UI with support for mouse interaction
Animated terminal-style text scroll, caret, and sound effects
Customizable terminal color, text speed, font size, and low-graphics mode
User authentication (login/signup), persistent settings via cookies and database
RESTful backend for user data, notes, messages, and configuration
Project pages with dynamic content, image carousels, and external links
Admin-only message management interface
Contact form with server-side message handling
Breadcrumb navigation reflecting user journey
Accessibility features including color themes and keyboard shortcuts
Architecture & Implementation Details:

Frontend: Built with Svelte and TypeScript, leveraging Svelte stores for global state (user session, settings, UI preferences). Components are modular, with reusable UI elements (e.g., ChoiceSelector, TextScroll, ColorSelector).
Routing: Managed via a writable store (currentRoute), with breadcrumb tracking for navigation context.
Customization: User preferences are stored in cookies and synchronized with backend settings for persistence across sessions.
Backend: RESTful API endpoints (PHP) handle authentication, settings, notes, and messages, interfacing with a normalized MySQL database.
Admin Features: Role-based access for message management, including search, read/unread toggling, and bulk deletion.
Testing: Playwright E2E tests validate core UI flows.
UI Effects: Custom Svelte components implement CRT scanlines, text flicker, and animated SVG cursor for authentic terminal aesthetics.
Responsive Design: CSS media queries ensure usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

Outcome / Impact:
Delivered a unique, interactive portfolio platform with high accessibility and engagement
Demonstrated advanced frontend engineering, state management, and integration with a secure backend
Achieved robust separation of concerns and extensibility for future features
