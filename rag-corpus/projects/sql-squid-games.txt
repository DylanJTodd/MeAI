Project Name: SQL Games (SQL Squid Games)
Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), Web Components, CodeMirror, SQL.js, Custom Elements, PostgreSQL/SQLite (simulated), Figma (UI prototyping)

Problem Solved:
Designed to gamify SQL learning and assessment, SQL Games provides an interactive, scenario-driven environment for users to practice and master SQL queries through progressively challenging, story-based exercises. The platform addresses the need for engaging, hands-on SQL education and self-assessment.

Key Features / Functionality:

Interactive SQL editor with syntax highlighting and auto-refresh (powered by CodeMirror)
Custom web components for exercises and quizzes (<sql-exercise>, <sql-quiz>)
Real-time SQL query execution and result validation using SQL.js
Scenario-based levels with dynamic problem statements and schema diagrams
Automated solution checking with feedback and progression logic
Modular, level-based HTML structure for extensibility
Integrated hints, explanations, and learning resources
Responsive UI with themed styling and accessibility considerations
Architecture & Implementation Details:

Modular codebase with separation of concerns:
main.js implements custom elements for exercises and quizzes, handles user input, query execution, and result comparison
codemirror.js and codemirrorsql.js provide SQL syntax highlighting and editor configuration
Each level is a standalone HTML file embedding custom components and referencing shared scripts and styles
SQL queries are executed client-side using SQL.js, enabling instant feedback without backend dependencies
Solution validation compares normalized query results, abstracting away row order and column naming differences
UI/UX designed in Figma and implemented with custom CSS themes for immersive gameplay
Extensible structure allows for easy addition of new levels, schemas, and challenges

Outcome / Impact:
Delivered an engaging, web-based SQL learning platform adopted for educational and recruitment purposes
Enhanced user engagement and retention through gamification and immediate feedback
Demonstrated effective use of modern web technologies and component-based architecture for interactive learning tools
