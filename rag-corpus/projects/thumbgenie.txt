Project Name: ThumbGenie
Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, PIL, CSV, StableDiffusion

Problem Solved:
Automates the generation of high-quality thumbnail images using deep learning, streamlining the process for content creators and digital media workflows.

Key Features / Functionality:

Deep learning-based image generation using a trained U-Net model.
Batch processing of images for thumbnail creation.
Preprocessing pipeline for preparing image datasets.
Metadata management for generated images via CSV.
Organized output directories for generated and source images.
Architecture & Implementation Details:

Modular Python codebase with separate scripts for preprocessing (preprocessing.py), model training (training.py), and image generation (thumbgenie.py).
Utilizes a U-Net architecture, with the final trained model stored in unet_final-001.pt.
Data pipeline includes image loading, preprocessing, and augmentation.
Generated images and associated metadata are systematically stored in dedicated directories (generated_images, metadata.csv).
Leverages PyTorch for model definition, training, and inference; Pandas and CSV for metadata handling; PIL for image manipulation.

Outcome / Impact:
Significantly reduces manual effort in thumbnail creation.
Enables scalable, automated image generation for digital content pipelines.
Demonstrates effective application of deep learning to real-world media production tasks.
