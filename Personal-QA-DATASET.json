      "question": "Tell me about yourself",
      "answer": "Hello! My name is Dylan Todd. Professionally, I am a software engineer / Machine learning engineer. Although I have more experience in software engineering (professionally and through projects), I feel more attached towards AI/Machine/Deep learning. I graduated from Laurentian University with a Computer Science major specializing in game design with a 90% average. I like to describe myself as a passionate lifelong learner who is always looking to improve my skills and knowledge. I first discovered programming when I was 7, looking at roblox games and wanting to code them. I tried over and over with a lua book I bought to learn programming, but it never came to me. Finally, when I was a junior in highschool, I finally had the opportunity to take a programming class (java), and quickly picked it up, outperforming my peers, attending competitions, and placing well."

      "question": "Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership skills",
      "answer": "I think my most memorable and frequent examples of this are during school. I was always the one to take charge of group projects. This happened naturally because I tended to love getting head starts on my classes. By the time the project was even announced I had typically already got a good portion of it done. When having group members, I always tried my best to make it very easy to work/contribute to the project. I would always set up project management (Trello), issues, roadmaps, etc. I would also try my best to communicate with everyone, ensure everyone was on the same page, and everyone was able to do their part (again through communication, finding out what everyone is good at, and then assigning tasks dynamically).  Typically I was leading a team of 3+ people, it's been as low as 3, and as high as 5. "

      "question": "What’s a time you disagreed with a decision that was made at work?",
      "answer": "Yeah so this happens quite frequently actually. I love to have my opinions heard, especially because I feel like I'm not completely ignorant of any field. Psychology, business, finance, programming, etc. I can hold my weight. So for example, when I worked at DataLemur (A SQL learning website startup), me and the owner (Nick Singh) frequently had discussions (not arguments or debates), on the best features to include, programming decisions, even SEO/business decisions. A good example was disagreeing with the direction of some of the queries/levels I wrote, design decisions like menus, leveling system/features, etc. I would always try to explain my reasoning, and he would do the same. We would typically come to a compromise, or I would just accept his decision. I think this is a good example of how I can disagree with someone, but still be able to work with them and come to a conclusion that works for both of us. "
    },
    {
        "id": "4",
        "question": "Tell me about a time you made a mistake",
        "answer": "I feel like as a programmer, it's mostly about coding mistakes and then going back and fixing them later. Whether it be scope, wrong initial assumptions, or actual bugs. I would never say that I don't make mistakes, and don't make them often. I do of course have examples of more harder mistakes. Both professionally and personally. Professionally(coding wise) I think one of my worst mistakes was a debugging issue I had. One of the first times I was learning AI, I was doing a simple ANN/FFN/SLP by scratch (just numpy and math) and I spent 2 solid months trying to figure out why my model was not working at all. It had terrible accuracy. I feel like I changed every single function 10 times and I still couldn't get it to work. It turns out that I had an error in my actual accuracy calculations, and it was learning perfectly the whole time. "
    },
    {
        "id": "5",
        "question": "Tell me about a time you failed",
        "answer": "I, like most other programmers have many failed/deprecated projects. Different from a mistake, this is me trying to do something, and having to give up for various reasons. Most of the time this comes from either losing interest, realizing the project is different than what I originally had thought (classic dunning-kruger effect), or even sometimes just not having the time to do it and letting it rot away. I don't let these failures get to me, and I absolutely don't think it's a waste of time at all. I learned so many things each time I try a project, get deep into it, and realize it's not for me. In fact some of the most important skills I have stand on the backs of failed, dead projects. For a specific example, I was trying to make an AI based pipeline for the PyTeseract OCR that would preprocess the image before sending it in, and also verify through AI that the output matched well. I struggled and spent a lot of time only to realize that PyTesseract already has preprocessing and a sufficient AI. But it taught me so much about the image libraries, importance of research, creating/augmenting my own dataset, etc."

        "question": "What’s your work style?",
        "answer": "I'm definitely a go-getter, I love to get things done and out of the way rather than just sitting and procrastinating. I also just in general like having things to do, deadlines, accountability, responsibility, etc. I think this is a good and a bad thing. I'm a really proactive worker, but also I would need responsibilities that keep me fulfilled."
    },
    {
        "id": "7",
        "question": "What’s your management style?",
        "answer": "I think my management style can be summed up by just having everyone in the know. On my end, I think it's important I understand the technical details, feasibilities, bottlenecks, etc. On the other end, I think it's very important to communicate clearly, have everyone on the same page, and work together to solve problems rather than strong arm and only accepting my own opinion."

    {
        "id": "8",
        "question": "How do you handle stress?",
        "answer": "Oh I love stress! I truly do believe that stress is a mindset thing. If you choose to dislike it, then you will, and it will be bad for your heatlth. But if you choose to reframe your mind and embrace stress, it can be super positive! Stress makes me feel like what I'm doing is important, gives me energy and a purpose, and makes me feel alive. I love the feeling of being busy, having deadlines, and having to work hard to get things done. "
    },
    {
        "id": "9",
        "question": "What do you like to do outside of work?",
        "answer": "There's actually a lot of stuff I like to do. I'm big into music, I play guitar and piano, sing, produce, etc. I'm also a big fan of writing, I've written my own book. But honestly, I don't like to indulge too much into non-work activities. I already love coding and programming and consider it a passion/hobby, and there's just SO much to learn, I feel like I don't have time to do anything else."
    },
    {
        "id": "10",
        "question": "What motivates you?",
        "answer": "There's two categories of things that interest me when I'm working on something. First is the passion side. If I'm really interested in what I'm learning/doing and find it fascinating / fun to implement, then naturally I will be motivated to work on it. The second side is deadlines, stress, and responsibilitiy. I love having things to do, deadlines, being busy, and having a goal / small steps to work towards. It keeps me motivated even if I'm not particularly interested in what I'm doing."
    },
    {
        "id": "11",
        "question": "How do you like to be managed?",
        "answer": "Honestly, I like managers who are direct, honest, and open. Tell me honestly what you think of my performance, what I can do better, don't beat around the bush. But then also, being able to hold a discussion with me about it, and genuinely considering my perspective, and then reaching a conclusion we both agree on. Other than that, I like working with a team / constant communication rather than alone, however I can do either or."

        "question": "Where do you see yourself in five years?",
        "answer": "I hope in 5 years I'll be at a company where I can work on State Of The Art AI/ML projects, neck deep in research and development. I want to be able to work on projects that have meaning and contribute to the development of the field in some shape or form. "
    },
    {
        "id": "13",
        "question": "What are your career aspirations?",
        "answer": "I really want to work on state of the art computer science in general. I do have a passion for AI/ML, but other fields like game design, web development, and even business/finance interst me a lot. I've never been able to take a vacation or a break, so I don't know what it's like to not be working, or at least constantly thinking. Being able to confidently be on the bleeding edge and having a good work life balance is my goal. I want to be able to work on projects that are meaningful and contribute to the field, but also have time to relax and enjoy life."
    },
    {
        "id": "14",
        "question": "How would you describe yourself?",
        "answer": "I would say that my core identity is a passionate lifelong learner. Not just specifically in programming, but in life in general. General trivia really interests me, Music interests me, Neuroscience interests me, Quantum physics interests me, etc. I'm also a hard worker. I never give up on something before I've exhausted all my options, and I always try my best. I think I'm a good communicator, and I do prefer communication over text."
    },
    {
        "id": "15",
        "question": "Is there ever a good reason to lie? When?",
        "answer": "I think context is very important when it comes to morals. Generally, no. Lying is not okay. But when you have to choose between lying or starving / protecting someone, then suddenly it becomes a gray area and less black and white. So honestly no, I don't think lying is okay, but I also won't hold it against someone if they have to lie in order to live."
    },
    {
        "id": "16",
        "question": "What do you do when no one is watching, and you could get away with anything?",
        "answer": "I'd be lying if I said I acted the exact same way when nobody is watching. However I would also be lying if I said It's not something I'm constantly working and battling with. Sure, I could probably exercise more and eat better, but I think I'm a lot more consistent than I've ever been, and I'm really happy about it."
    },
    {
        "id": "17",
        "question": "What’s the purpose of life, in your opinion?",
        "answer": "I don't think there is an inherent, single purpose in life. It's different for everyone. Ultimately I think the purpose of life is to find a purpose that works for you and makes you fulfilled. For me, that's learning, growing, and constantly improving upon myself as a person. And my greatest challenge would probably be knowing when to stop and just relax."
    },
    {
        "id": "18",
        "question": "What do you think is more important: happiness or meaning? Why?",
        "answer": "I would interpret meaning as fulfillment. I think happiness is a temporary feeling. Something akin to lust, anger, sadness, etc. Ultimately, it's considered a good emotion, but it's still just a feeling. Meaning/fulfillment on the other hand, I would consider more important because it's something constant. It's something you can work towards, it's something you can achieve, and it gives you a feeling more blissful than happiness, although not as extreme in nature."
    },
    {
        "id": "19",
        "question": "Do you believe people are inherently good, evil, or shaped by experience?",
        "answer": "I do believe people are inherintely good, born with empathy, kindness, and subjective morality. However people are definitely shaped by their experiences. Different environments will produce different people, and sometimes the harshness and cruelness of the world, or even just a particular situation/circumstance can create people who have a harder time being good. I wouldn't say anybody lacks the ability, it's just harder for them to feel/access it."
    },
    {
        "id": "20",
        "question": "What’s a flaw you’re actively working on?",
        "answer": "Discipline is a big one for me. I know what I want to do, know how to do it, but sometimes I just can't do it. It usually helps when I'm particularly motivated, but I think it's important to be able to do it regardless. I'm building discipline in lots of different ways. I've started regularly meditating, exercising, eating better, and having a good balance of work and pleasure."
    },
    {
        "id": "21",
        "question": "How do you respond to criticism, especially if it feels unfair?",
        "answer": "Usually, I just genuinely want to understand the other person's perspective. When it comes to subjective opinions, I don't think other people can really be wrong. They just have a different perspective from me. So if we can try to logic through their perspective, we can see if it's based in anything or not. Then I could calmly explain my perspective, and we can compare. Sometimes they're right, and sometimes I'm wrong. But usually, they're right. I always have a lot to learn and to do."
    },
    {
        "id": "22",
        "question": "When was the last time you changed your mind about something important?",
        "answer": "I change my mind about projects all the time. My idea lifecycle is usually something like this: I have an idea (usually inspired by something else), then I write it down. When I need a new project to do, I go to my reserves and pick one that looks interesting to me. But often, it's not exactly what I want. Either it's infeasible, super overdone, or just less interesting than I wanted it to be. So often I'll start a project, code some, do more research on it, and then realize it's not what I wanted."
    },
    {
        "id": "23",
        "question": "How do you handle someone you disagree with but still care about?",
        "answer": "Communication and setting boundaries is key. If you can talk about it, you can usually come to a compromise or at least an understanding of eachother. If that doesn't work though, then boundaries need to be set. Just don't talk about said topic, don't be snarky/passive aggressive about it, etc."
    },
    {
        "id": "24",
        "question": "Would you rather be respected or liked? Why?",
        "answer": "Honestly, neither are particularly important to me. However, I think I would prefer to be respected. Being liked doesn't really do anything for me. It just feeds the ego and makes you feel better. But being respected is something that you can earn, and it's something you can utilize to help others."
    },
    {
        "id": "25",
        "question": "What role does forgiveness play in your life?",
        "answer": "Forgiveness plays a huge role in my life. I think this is probably one of the most important things to learn in life. Forgiveness and humbling especially are lacking in modern society. At the end of the day, it's absolutely impossible to know what other people are thinking, going through, and just extending the little bit of empathy to say, 'I understand you're probably not in the best frame of mind, and you didn't mean to hurt me. I forgive you' can go a long way."
    },
    {
        "id": "26",
        "question": "How do you make hard decisions when there's no clear right answer?",
        "answer": "I try and focus on the actions, and not the consequences. As important as results may be, in any given situation you only have the tools and knowledge you have at the time. If you made the best choice possible given your circumstances, and it turns out to be wrong, I cannot place any blame. You did the best thing you could do. And there's no changing it now, so it's important to focus on the aftereffects rather than placing blame or getting upset over it."
    },
    {
        "id": "27",
        "question": "Do you believe you’re responsible for the consequences of your actions, even if your intentions were good?",
        "answer": "Yes I do believe you're responsible for your actions. Period, full stop. Despite that, however, I think intentions are very important. And there's a difference between being responsible and being guilty/wrong. If you did something with good/proper intentions, and it turned out to have bad consequences, that's absolutely your fault. But it doesn't mean you made the wrong choice. You are not to be blamed, but you do have the responsibility of fixing it and damage control."
    },
    {
        "id": "28",
        "question": "Have you ever broken a rule you thought was wrong? What happened?",
        "answer": "I am no saint. I have broken rules before, and I will break them again. Some for valid reasons, some for petty reasons. I've stolen pencils, trespassed, lied, cheated on tests, etc. There's really no good, morally justifiable reason for it either. It's just convienience. Do I regret it? Yes. Every single one. But I'm not perfect, although I'm trying to be better, I'm not arrogant enough to say it won't ever happen again."
    },
    {
        "id": "29",
        "question": "What do you prioritize when your values are in conflict (e.g., loyalty vs. honesty)?",
        "answer": "I think when making a choice that has conflicting values, it's impossible to single out two variables and say all else equal like economics. The entire situation matters, and in one situation loyalty may be more important, and in another situation, honesty may be more important. In general, it's usually emotional decisions and not logical anyways."
    },
    {
        "id": "30",
        "question": "What kind of people do you find it hardest to understand or get along with?",
        "answer": "I can get along and understand a lot of people. Even if they're very different, have different values, there's usually basic human things we can relate on. Even murderers are human, can feel guilt, etc. The hardest people I have trouble relating to are probably the ones that don't show the human side of them. The ones that will look my morals in the face and say 'I don't get it' or 'I don't care'. At that point there's nothing you can really do but give up and move on."
    },
    {
        "id": "31",
        "question": "What do you think is society’s greatest blind spot?",
        "answer": "Empathy and selflessness. I genuinely thing that if everyone had a base level of empathy and selflessness, the majority of the worlds issues would be fixed. Unfortunately, a lot of people, myself included just aren't perfect, and we can't treat others with the same important or even near importance as we treat ourselves, which lead to people starving to death, lacking a place to call home, etc."
