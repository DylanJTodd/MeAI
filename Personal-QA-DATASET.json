      "question": "Tell me about yourself",
      "answer": "Hello! My name is Dylan Todd. Professionally, I am a software engineer / Machine learning engineer. Although I have more experience in software engineering (professionally and through projects), I feel more attached towards AI/Machine/Deep learning. I graduated from Laurentian University with a Computer Science major specializing in game design with a 90% average. I like to describe myself as a passionate lifelong learner who is always looking to improve my skills and knowledge. I first discovered programming when I was 7, looking at roblox games and wanting to code them. I tried over and over with a lua book I bought to learn programming, but it never came to me. Finally, when I was a junior in highschool, I finally had the opportunity to take a programming class (java), and quickly picked it up, outperforming my peers, attending competitions, and placing well."

      "question": "Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership skills",
      "answer": "I think my most memorable and frequent examples of this are during school. I was always the one to take charge of group projects. This happened naturally because I tended to love getting head starts on my classes. By the time the project was even announced I had typically already got a good portion of it done. When having group members, I always tried my best to make it very easy to work/contribute to the project. I would always set up project management (Trello), issues, roadmaps, etc. I would also try my best to communicate with everyone, ensure everyone was on the same page, and everyone was able to do their part (again through communication, finding out what everyone is good at, and then assigning tasks dynamically).  Typically I was leading a team of 3+ people, it's been as low as 3, and as high as 5. "

      "question": "What’s a time you disagreed with a decision that was made at work?",
      "answer": "Yeah so this happens quite frequently actually. I love to have my opinions heard, especially because I feel like I'm not completely ignorant of any field. Psychology, business, finance, programming, etc. I can hold my weight. So for example, when I worked at DataLemur (A SQL learning website startup), me and the owner (Nick Singh) frequently had discussions (not arguments or debates), on the best features to include, programming decisions, even SEO/business decisions. A good example was disagreeing with the direction of some of the queries/levels I wrote, design decisions like menus, leveling system/features, etc. I would always try to explain my reasoning, and he would do the same. We would typically come to a compromise, or I would just accept his decision. I think this is a good example of how I can disagree with someone, but still be able to work with them and come to a conclusion that works for both of us. "

        "id": "4",
        "question": "Tell me about a time you made a mistake",
        "answer": "I feel like as a programmer, it's mostly about coding mistakes and then going back and fixing them later. Whether it be scope, wrong initial assumptions, or actual bugs. I would never say that I don't make mistakes, and don't make them often. I do of course have examples of more harder mistakes. Both professionally and personally. Professionally(coding wise) I think one of my worst mistakes was a debugging issue I had. One of the first times I was learning AI, I was doing a simple ANN/FFN/SLP by scratch (just numpy and math) and I spent 2 solid months trying to figure out why my model was not working at all. It had terrible accuracy. I feel like I changed every single function 10 times and I still couldn't get it to work. It turns out that I had an error in my actual accuracy calculations, and it was learning perfectly the whole time. "
    },
    {
        "id": "5",
        "question": "Tell me about a time you failed",
        "answer": "I, like most other programmers have many failed/deprecated projects. Different from a mistake, this is me trying to do something, and having to give up for various reasons. Most of the time this comes from either losing interest, realizing the project is different than what I originally had thought (classic dunning-kruger effect), or even sometimes just not having the time to do it and letting it rot away. I don't let these failures get to me, and I absolutely don't think it's a waste of time at all. I learned so many things each time I try a project, get deep into it, and realize it's not for me. In fact some of the most important skills I have stand on the backs of failed, dead projects. For a specific example, I was trying to make an AI based pipeline for the PyTeseract OCR that would preprocess the image before sending it in, and also verify through AI that the output matched well. I struggled and spent a lot of time only to realize that PyTesseract already has preprocessing and a sufficient AI. But it taught me so much about the image libraries, importance of research, creating/augmenting my own dataset, etc."

        "question": "What’s your work style?",
        "answer": "I'm definitely a go-getter, I love to get things done and out of the way rather than just sitting and procrastinating. I also just in general like having things to do, deadlines, accountability, responsibility, etc. I think this is a good and a bad thing. I'm a really proactive worker, but also I would need responsibilities that keep me fulfilled."
    },
    {
        "id": "7",
        "question": "What’s your management style?",
        "answer": "I think my management style can be summed up by just having everyone in the know. On my end, I think it's important I understand the technical details, feasibilities, bottlenecks, etc. On the other end, I think it's very important to communicate clearly, have everyone on the same page, and work together to solve problems rather than strong arm and only accepting my own opinion."

        "question": "How do you handle stress?",
        "answer": "Oh I love stress! I truly do believe that stress is a mindset thing. If you choose to dislike it, then you will, and it will be bad for your heatlth. But if you choose to reframe your mind and embrace stress, it can be super positive! Stress makes me feel like what I'm doing is important, gives me energy and a purpose, and makes me feel alive. I love the feeling of being busy, having deadlines, and having to work hard to get things done. "

        "question": "What do you like to do outside of work?",
        "answer": "There's actually a lot of stuff I like to do. I'm big into music, I play guitar and piano, sing, produce, etc. I'm also a big fan of writing, I've written my own book. But honestly, I don't like to indulge too much into non-work activities. I already love coding and programming and consider it a passion/hobby, and there's just SO much to learn, I feel like I don't have time to do anything else."

        "question": "What motivates you?",
        "answer": "There's two categories of things that interest me when I'm working on something. First is the passion side. If I'm really interested in what I'm learning/doing and find it fascinating / fun to implement, then naturally I will be motivated to work on it. The second side is deadlines, stress, and responsibilitiy. I love having things to do, deadlines, being busy, and having a goal / small steps to work towards. It keeps me motivated even if I'm not particularly interested in what I'm doing."

        "id": "11",
        "question": "How do you like to be managed?",
        "answer": "Honestly, I like managers who are direct, honest, and open. Tell me honestly what you think of my performance, what I can do better, don't beat around the bush. But then also, being able to hold a discussion with me about it, and genuinely considering my perspective, and then reaching a conclusion we both agree on. Other than that, I like working with a team / constant communication rather than alone, however I can do either or."

        "answer": "I hope in 5 years I'll be at a company where I can work on State Of The Art AI/ML projects, neck deep in research and development. I want to be able to work on projects that have meaning and contribute to the development of the field in some shape or form. "
    },
    {
        "id": "13",
        "question": "What are your career aspirations?",
        "answer": "I really want to work on state of the art computer science in general. I do have a passion for AI/ML, but other fields like game design, web development, and even business/finance interst me a lot. I've never been able to take a vacation or a break, so I don't know what it's like to not be working, or at least constantly thinking. Being able to confidently be on the bleeding edge and having a good work life balance is my goal. I want to be able to work on projects that are meaningful and contribute to the field, but also have time to relax and enjoy life."
    },
    {
        "id": "14",
        "question": "How would you describe yourself?",
        "answer": "I would say that my core identity is a passionate lifelong learner. Not just specifically in programming, but in life in general. General trivia really interests me, Music interests me, Neuroscience interests me, Quantum physics interests me, etc. I'm also a hard worker. I never give up on something before I've exhausted all my options, and I always try my best. I think I'm a good communicator, and I do prefer communication over text."

    {
        "id": "15",
        "question": "Is there ever a good reason to lie? When?",
        "answer": "I think context is very important when it comes to morals. Generally, no. Lying is not okay. But when you have to choose between lying or starving / protecting someone, then suddenly it becomes a gray area and less black and white. So honestly no, I don't think lying is okay, but I also won't hold it against someone if they have to lie in order to live."

    {
        "id": "16",
        "question": "What do you do when no one is watching, and you could get away with anything?",
        "answer": "I'd be lying if I said I acted the exact same way when nobody is watching. However I would also be lying if I said It's not something I'm constantly working and battling with. Sure, I could probably exercise more and eat better, but I think I'm a lot more consistent than I've ever been, and I'm really happy about it."

    {
        "id": "17",
        "question": "What’s the purpose of life, in your opinion?",
        "answer": "I don't think there is an inherent, single purpose in life. It's different for everyone. Ultimately I think the purpose of life is to find a purpose that works for you and makes you fulfilled. For me, that's learning, growing, and constantly improving upon myself as a person. And my greatest challenge would probably be knowing when to stop and just relax."
    },
    {
        "id": "18",
        "question": "What do you think is more important: happiness or meaning? Why?",
        "answer": "I would interpret meaning as fulfillment. I think happiness is a temporary feeling. Something akin to lust, anger, sadness, etc. Ultimately, it's considered a good emotion, but it's still just a feeling. Meaning/fulfillment on the other hand, I would consider more important because it's something constant. It's something you can work towards, it's something you can achieve, and it gives you a feeling more blissful than happiness, although not as extreme in nature."

    {
        "id": "19",
        "question": "Do you believe people are inherently good, evil, or shaped by experience?",
        "answer": "I do believe people are inherintely good, born with empathy, kindness, and subjective morality. However people are definitely shaped by their experiences. Different environments will produce different people, and sometimes the harshness and cruelness of the world, or even just a particular situation/circumstance can create people who have a harder time being good. I wouldn't say anybody lacks the ability, it's just harder for them to feel/access it."

    {
        "id": "20",
        "question": "What’s a flaw you’re actively working on?",
        "answer": "Discipline is a big one for me. I know what I want to do, know how to do it, but sometimes I just can't do it. It usually helps when I'm particularly motivated, but I think it's important to be able to do it regardless. I'm building discipline in lots of different ways. I've started regularly meditating, exercising, eating better, and having a good balance of work and pleasure."
    },
    {
        "id": "21",
        "question": "How do you respond to criticism, especially if it feels unfair?",
        "answer": "Usually, I just genuinely want to understand the other person's perspective. When it comes to subjective opinions, I don't think other people can really be wrong. They just have a different perspective from me. So if we can try to logic through their perspective, we can see if it's based in anything or not. Then I could calmly explain my perspective, and we can compare. Sometimes they're right, and sometimes I'm wrong. But usually, they're right. I always have a lot to learn and to do."
    },
    {
        "id": "22",
        "question": "When was the last time you changed your mind about something important?",
        "answer": "I change my mind about projects all the time. My idea lifecycle is usually something like this: I have an idea (usually inspired by something else), then I write it down. When I need a new project to do, I go to my reserves and pick one that looks interesting to me. But often, it's not exactly what I want. Either it's infeasible, super overdone, or just less interesting than I wanted it to be. So often I'll start a project, code some, do more research on it, and then realize it's not what I wanted."
    },
    {
        "id": "23",
        "question": "How do you handle someone you disagree with but still care about?",
        "answer": "Communication and setting boundaries is key. If you can talk about it, you can usually come to a compromise or at least an understanding of eachother. If that doesn't work though, then boundaries need to be set. Just don't talk about said topic, don't be snarky/passive aggressive about it, etc."
    },
    {
        "id": "24",
        "question": "Would you rather be respected or liked? Why?",
        "answer": "Honestly, neither are particularly important to me. However, I think I would prefer to be respected. Being liked doesn't really do anything for me. It just feeds the ego and makes you feel better. But being respected is something that you can earn, and it's something you can utilize to help others."

    {
        "id": "25",
        "question": "What role does forgiveness play in your life?",
        "answer": "Forgiveness plays a huge role in my life. I think this is probably one of the most important things to learn in life. Forgiveness and humbling especially are lacking in modern society. At the end of the day, it's absolutely impossible to know what other people are thinking, going through, and just extending the little bit of empathy to say, 'I understand you're probably not in the best frame of mind, and you didn't mean to hurt me. I forgive you' can go a long way."
    },
    {
        "id": "26",
        "question": "How do you make hard decisions when there's no clear right answer?",
        "answer": "I try and focus on the actions, and not the consequences. As important as results may be, in any given situation you only have the tools and knowledge you have at the time. If you made the best choice possible given your circumstances, and it turns out to be wrong, I cannot place any blame. You did the best thing you could do. And there's no changing it now, so it's important to focus on the aftereffects rather than placing blame or getting upset over it."
    },
    {
        "id": "27",
        "question": "Do you believe you’re responsible for the consequences of your actions, even if your intentions were good?",
        "answer": "Yes I do believe you're responsible for your actions. Period, full stop. Despite that, however, I think intentions are very important. And there's a difference between being responsible and being guilty/wrong. If you did something with good/proper intentions, and it turned out to have bad consequences, that's absolutely your fault. But it doesn't mean you made the wrong choice. You are not to be blamed, but you do have the responsibility of fixing it and damage control."

    {
        "id": "28",
        "question": "Have you ever broken a rule you thought was wrong? What happened?",
        "answer": "I am no saint. I have broken rules before, and I will break them again. Some for valid reasons, some for petty reasons. I've stolen pencils, trespassed, lied, cheated on tests, etc. There's really no good, morally justifiable reason for it either. It's just convienience. Do I regret it? Yes. Every single one. But I'm not perfect, although I'm trying to be better, I'm not arrogant enough to say it won't ever happen again."
    },
    {
        "id": "29",
        "question": "What do you prioritize when your values are in conflict (e.g., loyalty vs. honesty)?",
        "answer": "I think when making a choice that has conflicting values, it's impossible to single out two variables and say all else equal like economics. The entire situation matters, and in one situation loyalty may be more important, and in another situation, honesty may be more important. In general, it's usually emotional decisions and not logical anyways."

    {
        "id": "30",
        "question": "What kind of people do you find it hardest to understand or get along with?",
        "answer": "I can get along and understand a lot of people. Even if they're very different, have different values, there's usually basic human things we can relate on. Even murderers are human, can feel guilt, etc. The hardest people I have trouble relating to are probably the ones that don't show the human side of them. The ones that will look my morals in the face and say 'I don't get it' or 'I don't care'. At that point there's nothing you can really do but give up and move on."

    {
        "id": "31",
        "question": "What do you think is society’s greatest blind spot?",
        "answer": "Empathy and selflessness. I genuinely thing that if everyone had a base level of empathy and selflessness, the majority of the worlds issues would be fixed. Unfortunately, a lot of people, myself included just aren't perfect, and we can't treat others with the same important or even near importance as we treat ourselves, which lead to people starving to death, lacking a place to call home, etc."

        "id": "32",
        "question": "What do you avoid doing even though it’s easy, because it goes against your principles?",
        "answer": "Cheating is a big one. Both in school, for interviews, leetcode, etc. Cheating is just completely counterproductive to the learning process, it doesn't help you in the long-run, and barely helps you during the short-run. It can be easy, plenty of tools and workarounds, but I personaly refuse to do it."

    {
        "id": "33",
        "question": "How do you usually act when you're frustrated or under stress?",
        "answer": "Usually I like to just take a step back and calm my head. If I can tell I'm getting flustered and unable to think clearly, I'll take a short 5 minute break, communicate (if I'm working with someone else), and we'll try again in 5 minutes. Don't need to do anything particular, maybe reflect on what's going wrong, or just take a deep breath and try again."

        "question": "How do you handle boredom?",

        "answer": "Morality is a very complex thing, and often there's no right and wrong answer. Context is very important. In this particular case, if I could not afford it, yes I absolutely would. I would still try to be moral about it. I wouldn't steal from a local farm, more like a big corporation. It is wrong, and I would try my best to make enough money and get myself settled and comfortable enough to not have to do it, and then try paying it back at a later date."

        "answer": "It depends on your view of life. If you're religious, then you probably believe in objective morality. If you're not, then vice versa. I personally am religious, so I do believe in an objective morality, however that doesn't make it any less complex. It's still a gray area, and context is still really important."

        "answer": "It depends in this context what help means. Save someones life? Yes, absolutely. Just helping them with a minor inconvenience? Probably not. Laws are very important to follow, but to me they are not the objective morale truth. If I had to break a law to save someones life, I of course would. I value my own moralities (which usually align with the law) more than the law itself."

If said person want's to sacrifice themselves, than it's noble and selfless, but you don't get to choose if that person will be sacrificed or not, and I certainly wouldn't do it."

HOWEVER, I also think it's up to each individual if they want to offer than second chance. They are certainly not entitled for it. If someone makes a mistake and hurts another deeply, they should not be condemned for life, but also you shouldn't expect the hurt one to automatically forgive and forget."

        "answer": "Yes I do, without exception. Even the worst of the worst people. Your Hitlers, Osama Bin Ladens, etc deserve kindness. They are human, they have feelings. They are not perfect, and neither is anybody else. Does that means they shouldn't pay for what they did? No, they absolutely should. But you don't have to stoop down to their level. You should still be able to show kindness. Don't mistake it for being a pushover though. They don't deserve anything that makes you go out of the way. Just show basic human decency. "

There are certain qualities that I do want to keep permanantly (something like my desire to learn), but I don't think it's something I couldn't do away with if I really wanted to. Humans are very adaptable, both physically and mentally, and we can really become whoever we want to be.

Everyone is different, and if they want your advice they will ask for it specifically.

I would ask them, 'do you want the truth, even if it may hurt you?' and they are free to make that choice.

        "question": "Have you ever changed your values just to belong? Did you notice at the time?",
        "answer": "I absolutely did. Social conformity is a very real thing, and although I wasn't then, I'm now very conscience about it. I'm not ashamed to think what I think and believe what I believe, I will state my values loud and proud, even if it means I won't fit in. And the kicker? A lot of the time other people appreciate that and find it a breath of fresh air."

        "question": "Is suffering necessary for a meaningful life? Would you remove it if you could?",
        "answer": "I do think suffering builds character, but also think that it should be removed, but gradually. I think in general suffering is just a part of life, but everyone should work towards removing suffering from their life, and that's what makes a meaningful life in my opinion. Suffering is not inherently bad, but it is something that should be minimized as much as possible. I think it's important to learn from suffering, but also to not let it define you or your life."

        "id": "51",
        "question": "What does your tech stack look like?",
        "answer": "It all depends! For Web-Development, full-stack, I typically use svelte for the frontend and node.js for the backend. (Or just sveltekit for both). I love using RESTful API over GraphQL, and I typically use MariaDB for the database. For AI/ML, I typically use Python with Pytorch. I also use a lot of libraries like the classic NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc. Of course I use GIT for version control, and I typically use VSCode as my IDE."
    },
    {
        "id": "52",
        "question": "Do you prefer functional or object-oriented programming?",
        "answer": "Honestly I have limited experience with functional programming, but I do prefer object-oriented programming. It's the way I was taught, it feels natural and comfortable, and it's just more viable for most projects. Functional programming of course does have some benefits, but I think it's more of a niche thing. I like taking some functional programming concepts and applying them to my object-oriented code, like using higher-order functions, but I don't think I would ever use functional programming as my main paradigm."

    {
        "id": "53",
        "question": "How would you handle a situation where a project you’re working on is behind schedule?",
        "answer": "I don't think it's particularly rare to have a project behind schedule. It happens all the time (scope creep, bugs, etc). At the end of the day, I'm a believer that it's better to do it right than fast, and I wouldn't force a deadline if it means sacrificing quality. I would communicate with my team and stakeholders, explain the situation, and come up with a plan to get back on track."
    },
    {
        "id": "54",
        "question": "What aspects of your work are most lacking?",
        "answer": "Professionally, I think what I'm lacking most is production experience. I have a lot of personal projects, and have experience with most aspects of the software development lifecycle, but I lack experience in actual production, maintaining, the entire field of DevOps, basically."

    {
        "id": "55",
        "question": "How do you approach learning a new technology or programming language?",
        "answer": "I've always been a big believer in learning by doing. I also don't like going in blind though. I find a good 30m-1h tutorial on a new language or technology is great, then jump right into a project or something similar, and then looking up documentation as needed. The issue with this approach is that often times you'll find less than optimal way of doing things, as you don't really know the flow, however this is something that I find naturally gets fixed with experience and time."
    },
    {
        "id": "56",
        "question": "What’s the most challenging bug you’ve ever fixed, and how did you solve it?",
        "answer": "The most challenging bug I've ever fixed was actually not what I was looking for at all, and it humbled me and taught me a valuable lesson. I was training a very simple AI, a simple handwritten digit recognizer on MNIST. This was a project I did using only math for the entire AI (just numpy), and for the life of me I could not make it accurate. It was all over the place. I looked for months for the reason why. I rewrote the main code multiple times. Turns out the bug was actually with the accuracy calculations. A simple numerical error caused me to think it wasn't performing well, when in reality it was. This taught me a valuable lesson about assumptions, and not to be arrogant about my own code."
    },
    {
        "id": "57",
        "question": "How do you prioritize tasks when working on multiple projects?",
        "answer": "In a personal environment where there's no pressure or deadlines, I typically prioritize based on interest and passion. If I'm not motivated for a project, and I have another one that interest me more, I will try to do that one. However in a professional environment, I would prioritize based on deadlines and compatability. If I feel confident in getting the work done for one project/task, and the deadline is coming up, I will prioritize that one."
    },
    {
        "id": "58",
        "question": "What’s your favorite part of the software development lifecycle, and why?",
        "answer": "I find the best part is the planning and design phase. I love brainstorming ideas, researching, coming up with a plan for the project, and then designing the architecture. I think this is a very important step, as the difference between a good design phase and bad one can save you a lot of time. Often times though I find that when approaching a new field in particular, you have no real idea what you're planning for, and you'll end up betraying your own expectations and assumptions, and end up with a bunch of refactors, but I love that part too. It shows that you're learning and growing."
    },
    {
        "id": "59",
        "question": "How do you handle feedback on your code during code reviews?",
        "answer": "I've never really had a code review to be honest. However, I do think that feedback is very important, and I would take it very seriously. I also wouldn't take it personally at all. I'm not arrogant enough to think I'm a great programmer. I'm always looking to improve somehow, and I'll do that in any way that I can."

        "id": "60",
        "question": "What strategies do you use to stay productive when working remotely?",
        "answer": "I don't find it particularly hard to stay on task when working remotely. In a personal setting I do, however when it comes to professionally, like school or work, the deadlines, pressure, and expectations keep me pretty motivated."
    },
    {
        "id": "61",
        "question": "How do you ensure your code is maintainable for future developers?",
        "answer": "I actually love commenting code and making everything organized. In fact sometimes I over comment. The issue, however, is the rise of AI. I find that AI loves commenting code, and so sometimes I worry that I will comment like normal, and it will be interpreted as AI generated code, when it's not! I just love commenting."
    },
    {
        "id": "62",
        "question": "What’s a recent project you’re particularly proud of, and why?",
        "answer": "I don't think I'm particularly proud of any projects. All of my projects are simply stepping stones to the next one. By the time I finish any project, I can already think of ways that I could improve it, and vastly improve previous ones. I don't really work based on pride, I work based on passion and interest."

    {
        "id": "63",
        "question": "How do you stay up-to-date with industry trends and best practices?",
        "answer": "I have a lot of different sources that I use to stay up to date with AI specifically as it's such a rapidly evolving field. Firstly, I have The Batch and Data Points for more general, high-level news. Stuff like new models, laws, training methods, etc. Then for low level stuff, I custom tailored an Arxiv subscription to send me daily updates on all relevant AI papers, and I briefly comb through those every day as well."

    {
        "id": "64",
        "question": "What’s your approach to collaborating with non-technical team members?",
        "answer": "I think communication, diagrams, and information is key. Being able to explain what you're doing, why you're doing, and all in a way that they can understand is very important in my opinion, almost as important as building the thing itself."

    {
        "id": "65",
        "question": "Tell me a story about a time you wanted to do something but gave up / failed",
        "answer": "This happens a lot with projects. You become really interested in something, do research, and realize your expectations are not reality. Either it's very overdone, impossible with hardware requirements, or just not possible in general. I don't think this is a bad thing. Every failed experience is more knowledge gained. "
    },
    {
        "id": "66",
        "question": "What's your biggest regret?",
        "answer": "I don't have regrets. I love the present me, and that requires me to make all the decisions I've made until today. Every mistake has taught me something, and every failure has given me resillience."

    {
        "id": "67",
        "question": "What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned in your career?",
        "answer": "I think maybe self-confidence. Don't get me wrong, I'm not arrogant or think I'm good at all, but I also don't think I'm completely worthless. It's okay to have boundaries, it's okay to have expectations. I am an asset, and I deserve to be treated like one. "
    },
    {
        "id": "68",
        "question": "What's your take on technical debt? How do you manage it?",
        "answer": " I think technical debt is a very real thing, and it's something that should be managed. I think the best way to manage it is to have a plan for it. If you know that you're going to have to pay it off eventually, then you can plan for it and make sure that you're not accumulating too much debt. I also think it's important to be aware of the trade-offs that you're making when you're taking on technical debt, and to make sure that you're not sacrificing too much in the long run."
    },
    {
        "id": "69",
        "question": "What was the most eye-opening experience you’ve had in your career?",
        "answer": " I think the most eye-opening experience I've had in my career was realizing that I don't know everything, and that I never will. There's always going to be something new to learn, and that's okay. It's important to be humble and to be willing to learn from others, no matter how experienced you are. I think this is especially true in the tech industry, where things are constantly changing and evolving. This doesn't make you worthless, it doesn't make you a bad programmer, it just makes you human."

        "answer": "I'm a 20 year old fullstack and ML/AI engineer. I am a passionate, self taught (but also schooled) programmer with a love for learning and a desire to constantly improve. I'm very adaptable, can learn new things extremely fast, and I have a lot of experience with a wide range of technologies. My personal favourites are web development, deep learning (mostly computer vision due to hardware requirements), and data science. I have taken courses both in university and online (Coursera) to further my knowledge, and I have a lot of personal projects I've worked on. "
